# whackamole
Whack a mole game hosted on AWS (AWS Amplify) with cognito login, dynamoDB for storage, and graphql API.

Made to apply for the react native developer position at SmartPath. Hope you guys like it!

I have a Windows laptop, so I was not able to develop this for iOS. Please run the game on android for an optimal experience.

## Steps to run the react-native app

1) clone the repository
2) `npm install`
3) `npm run android` with an android device (with developer options and usb debugging enabled) connected to the computer

  >To enable USB debugging on your device, you will first need to enable the "Developer options" menu by going to Settings → About phone → Software information and then tapping the Build number row at the bottom seven times. You can then go back to Settings → Developer options to enable "USB debugging".
